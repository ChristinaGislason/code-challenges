# code-challenges

Throughout this course, we will complete a set of daily code challenges. Each set will contain up to ten problems.

We will be working on these code challenges with a new partner every day. These will also be our partners for the paired lab. Code challenges that are assigned when heading into the weekend will be completed independently.

After lecture, we get together with our partner and read through the daily set of challenges. We must read the MDN documentation for the topic(s) of the day. The instructor will also be sharing a YouTube playlist which contains tutorials on each topic. Each video is approximately ten minutes long and we will try to integrate these videos into the workflow as seen fit.
